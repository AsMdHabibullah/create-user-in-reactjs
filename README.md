# Function implementation how to create a user account by using reactjs

## In this application I use 
```
    1. React.Js
    2. Redux.Js
    3. React-Redux
    4. Axios
    5. Thunk
    6. React-Bootstrap 4.x
```

### Why all of this library?
```
    1. React.Js --> Core functionalty of reactjs
    [
    2. Redux.Js
    3. React-Redux
    4. Axios
    5. Thunk
    ] --> Controle backend API and all of the state of this app.
    6. React-Bootstrap 4.x --> It's a good HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript toolkit to create eye catching UI
```
